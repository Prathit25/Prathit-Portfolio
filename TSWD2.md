# Assignment 2: Visualizing Government Debt

## OECD website embedded data:

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Okw" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Okw" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2021</a></iframe>

## Graphic on Flourish (from instructions):
This graphic was created on Flourish to highlight trends of debt-to-GDP ratio for different countries over time:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11162735"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

## Another graphic on Flourish:
Following graphic was created to make the previous graphic more visually appealing, by keeping the areas and lines that highlights the trend of debt-to-GDP ratio over time:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11164217"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I am adding and highlighting areas under Debt-to-GDP ratios over time to emphasize on its trend. Also, I selected brown color with a lower opacity as blue color felt too bright to me. I hovered around other chart styles as well, but line chart with areas seemed most appropriate to me in this context.


## Tableau Heatmap testing:
This is an optional heatmap that was guided on Canvas to illustrate the data in a different manner on Tableau:

<script type='text/javascript' src='https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 1536px; height: 711px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='1536' height='711' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fprod-useast-a.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;prathit' /><param name='name' value='Dent-to-GDPratio&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /></object></div>
