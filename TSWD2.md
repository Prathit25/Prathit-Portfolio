# Assignment 2: Visualizing Government Debt

## OECD website embedded data:

<iframe src="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Okw" width="860" height="645" style="border: 0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen="true"><a href="https://data.oecd.org/chart/6Okw" target="_blank">OECD Chart: General government debt, Total, % of GDP, Annual, 2021</a></iframe>

## Graphic on Flourish (from instructions):
This graphic was created on Flourish to highlight trends of debt-to-GDP ratio for different countries over time:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11162735"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

## Another graphic on Flourish:
Following graphic was created to make the previous graphic more visually appealing, by keeping the areas and lines that highlights the trend of debt-to-GDP ratio over time:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11164217"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I am adding and highlighting areas under Debt-to-GDP ratios over time to emphasize on its trend. Also, I selected brown color with a lower opacity as blue color felt too bright to me. I hovered around other chart styles as well, but line chart with areas seemed most appropriate to me in this context.


## Tableau Heatmap testing:
This is an optional highlight table that was guided on Canvas to illustrate the data in a different manner on Tableau:

<script type='text/javascript' src='https://prod-useast-a.online.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js'></script><div class='tableauPlaceholder' style='width: 1536px; height: 711px;'><object class='tableauViz' width='1536' height='711' style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fprod-useast-a.online.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='&#47;t&#47;prathit' /><param name='name' value='Dent-to-GDPratio&#47;Sheet1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='showAppBanner' value='false' /></object></div>

## Summary:

All graphics show government debts in the form of debt-to-GDP ratio. By default, OECD data shows latest data of that ratio in form of bar charts. It was not clear enough to compare those ratios of different countries, as the chart on OECD website shows average values when not all the bars have data points for every year. That is why, grid of line charts were prepared on flourish to compare those charts. Still, because it was difficult to comprehend data on the first look, I added areas to those line charts to clearly visualize them. I explored using different charts for better visualization such as column charts (stacked and grouped), bar charts and combo charts, but all of the charts either could not fit all data points in one graphic or were a little bit misleading. Therefore, I ended up adding areas to the line charts created before, which I thought was the most readable graphic. Further, highlight table on Tableau provided a clear comparison of debt-to-GDP ratio, and also a country specific trend over 25 years.
