## Part 3 writeup

Broadly, I was trying to motivate Indian residential customers to contribute in India's solar energy targets by 2030. I made a story in a way that non-technical people also can understand and get motivated by this. This writeup will summarize my changes from part 1 and 2:

### Learnings from part 1

Initially, my sketches and story was not engaging to the readers, as readers were not motivated enough from the story arc, and could not relate why should they invest in the solar energy in the first place, leaving the "how" part aside. Therefore, they told me that making a base of what renewable energy is, and providing a context of how renewable energy is better than their conventional energy counterparts would motivate readers to read the story further. Therefore, I decided to include a writeup about 'What is renewable energy?' In the same section, renewable energy sources were compared with their conventional energy counterparts to make them visualize how crucial it is to shift towards rnewable energy.

### Learnings from part 2

Finishing up part 2 was already a major milestone in direction of final project. After first part of the story, I created the "what is renewable energy?" section. However, I was only focusing on infopgrahics and visualizations of the story arc, and hardly could add any text. Therefrore, when I interviewed people for part 2, I could only ask them broad questions about overall flow of the story arc, and their feedback on the visuals. The most common feedback I received was to remain consistent in color coding, and highlight solar energy data from the beginnningso that readers know what to focus on, and that it was difficult to gauge who the intended audience was, unless the story is explained beforehand.

Therefore, I made the following broad changes to the story:

1. Started highlighting solar energy data from the first visual itself. Also, I selected the Blue color as solar panels are usually blue in color and readers would be easily able to follow.
2. I used blue colors in all the charts as well, to remain consistent with my color coding. 
3. I changed words in my narrative. For example, in the call to action slide of "What can YOU do?", I changed that to "What can YOU do as an average-income individual?" so that readers would know it is for average individual/residential customers. 
4. I removed the 4th chart of 450 GW targets, realizing that making a visualization for the entire chart would create redundancy in the data. Instead, I added a panel just before "What can YOU do as an average-income individual?" to show the opportunity available for residential customers, so that the focus remains where it should be.


### Intended Audience

As mentioned earlier, intended audience for this project are average income residents in India. In part 2, because I did not include specifically who my target audience is, none of the interviewees could figure out who the exact targeted audience was. According to their background, I could literally sense their unconcsious biases in assuming who the target audience would be. 

Therefore, I included specifically in the title slide that how can an individual contribute to a nation's clean energy transition targets in the next decade. To make it obvious, yet not direct, I have mentioned about that individual in the second person from as "YOU". Most commonly, I assumed that when an article or video says "how can YOU make an impact?", author tries to reach the broader audience, and therefore, residents in this context.


### Additional notes

Additionally, when making a final story, I figured that renewable energy chart is not highlighting solar energy data in the first chart (life cycle emissions comparison chart). To make it visually more appealing, I created a pictogram comparing conventional vs renewable energy technologies' life cycle emissions. For the same chart, I also realized that using more colors diverted readers' focus away from solar energy data. Therefore, I made all the icons gray except solar energy. Importing icons was also a long task, as I had to download the svg file, upload it on figma and copy paste the "path" to Flourish in order to render that icon in Pictogram.

Further, I got motivation of making bar chart race from a peer who made a line chart race on flourish. I thought providing a bar chart race will highlight the steep ascend of India's progress in solar energy adoption in the last decade. The only thing I had to take care in that was the animation time of that chart, as I only had one minute to present and therefore I would only have around 10 seconds to read that slide.

Finally, during my final editing process, I found out that some of the sections had significantly more text than the sections in the latter half. For the readers who just want to skim through the entire story, I added highlights of those sections which might help them navigate through the entire story without having to read every small detail.
