# Outline: 

The project will summarize India’s rooftop solar energy targets, the country’s progress towards achieving those targets and how can average income households contribute to them.

# Broad structure:

1. An overview about renewable energy and how is it better than conventional energy
2. India specific statistics (Renewable energy targets, solar energy targets, and India’s progress towards meeting those targets): This section will cover some sketches to highlight renewable energy deployment targets set by Indian government. The flow will be narrowed down to solar energy statistics. That will summarize solar energy deployment targets, and the progress towards achieving those targets by 2030. 
3. What is the gap between targets and current progress?: This section will focus on the gaps of targets and progress towards meeting those targets. 
Different types of solar energy systems, and portion of residential solar PV systems in total installed capacity: There are two major types of solar PV systems named Utility or large scale solar plants and rooftop solar plants. I would then further discuss of role and types of rooftop solar plants, and narrow down to residential solar customers.
4. What can average income households do to support this energy transition process?: This point will be demonstrated by available policies and financial assistance provided by state and federal governments.
5. Impact by a single household in meeting solar energy targets: This section will give audience a call to action, concluding the of how residential solar plants can contribute to India’s solar energy targets.


# Sketches:

Sketches for steps 2 and 3 will form a basis for the project. The following sketches will depict India’s current trend of solar energy installations, as well as gives an idea of what needs to be done to meet India’s solar energy targets.

India’s statewise solar energy installations with its geographical distribution depicts how solar plants are deployed throughout the nation. 


The bar graph shows the progress of India’s solar energy systems installations throughout last decade. It shows its exponential growth. Further, I would try to convey how much further deployment of solar power is needed to meet the targets as an extension of this graphic. 


Other tables, graphics or visualizations will not be this interactive, as they will focus more on conveying information such as availability of reduction in carbon emissions, policies, and their impact on meeting targets. I could not visualize them at this point, as I do not have information on that until I move forward with the story and some minor calculations. Those graphics would highlight the final parts of my story, and conclude the story with a call to action for the residential customers.


# Data:

Cumulative solar power capacity: This official press note will provide me with the latest solar installation data, that includes solar energy cumulative installed capacity, solar rooftop plants installation, major programmes and schemes to support progress in solar rooftop plant deployment. As an assumption, same share of solar power installed capacity given in this pressnote will be extrapolated to make calculations for the target by 2030, and to make calculations of an impact of average household resident.


Physical progress of solar energy: This site provides with building the overview of solar energy progress in India

State-wise installed capacity: This document provides the latest data of statewise solar plant capacity in India. In the overview section, this data might help me in making Indian map visual to depict statewise installed capacity data.

Year wise grid connected solar power capacity: This will help me build the base of grid connected solar installations till financial year 2018 - 2019. For data of next two financial years, the following links of MNRE annual reports will be used:
MNRE annual report 2019-20: This report has the data of India’s solar energy installation for the year 2019-20 on page 19 (Final row of the table)
MNRE state wise install capacity as on 31.03.2021: This downloadable excel file has data of total installed capacity as for the year 2020-21.

All these links will be used to set up a graphic with solar energy installation trend, and to show the gap between total target and current progress.


# Method and Medium:

My project will most likely to be developed on Shorthand, as that tool was explored and discussed during the class, and seemed easy to use to make stories. To make graphics and charts necessary to build visually appealing story, I would use Flourish and Tableau. Mostly the charts would be simple enough to convey the trends in solar energy deployment in India, and various states in them. Therefore, it would be easier to use the tools that I have already used before in the class exercises and homework. If I need to make any visuals just to make the flow more appealing, I might use Canva for that.
