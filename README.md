# Prathit-Portfolio
Portfolio for the course Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me 
Hello! I am Prathit Dave (he/him). I am a master's student in Energy Science, Technology and Policy program. I will graduate in December 2022. 

Prior to CMU, I was working in an energy research think tank where my projects included giving advisory support to state and central governments. I intend to work in the similar area after graduating from CMU.

# What I hope to learn
Broadly, I am hoping to learn what the course title says - effectively telling stories with data. Having worked in an advisory organization before, I came to know how important data visulizations could be. I want to learn how to convey my work in form of appealing visuals with appropriate designs and use of colors to make them more impactful.
