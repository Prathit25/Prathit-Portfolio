# Part 2: Final Project

## Shorthand flow:

I have started building my final project on shorthand. The screenshots below gives a broad structure of my shorthand story. For now, I intend to keep flow of the story in the following manner:

1. Title Slide: Solar Energy progress in India
2. Background slide: What is renewable energy? How is it better than conventional energy?
3. India's Progress and targets: How much progress has India made to meet their targets by 2030?
4. Type of solar energy systems: Out of total target of 450 GW, how much from that is allocated for solar? How much for solar rooftop sites?
5. What can you as an individual do?
6. Government subsidies and schemes to motivate residential customers
7. References


Description in each sections will provide detailed context about rationale of the story, and infographics should attract readers to increase their engagement.
