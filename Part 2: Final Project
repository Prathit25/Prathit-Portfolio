# Part 2: Final Project

## Shorthand flow:

I have started building my final project on shorthand. The screenshots below gives a broad structure of my shorthand story. For now, I intend to keep flow of the story in the following manner:

1. Title Slide: Solar Energy progress in India
2. Background slide: What is renewable energy? How is it better than conventional energy?
3. India's Progress and targets: How much progress has India made to meet their targets by 2030?
4. Type of solar energy systems: Out of total target of 450 GW, how much from that is allocated for solar? How much for solar rooftop sites?
5. What can you as an individual do?
6. Government subsidies and schemes to motivate residential customers
7. References


Description in each sections will provide detailed context about rationale of the story, and infographics should attract readers to increase their engagement.

## User research and interview questionnaire:

According the project flow I have developed, I would first ask them broad questions on their view on the flow and structure. and then would narrow down my questions specific to slides:

1. What do you think this story is for? What points do you think I am trying to convey here?
2. Who do you think is the intended audience for this story? Why is that and how is the story relevant to them?

After that, I would briefly explain the story to them and then ask the following questions:

1. How do you think are the charts coming up to highlight the crux of every section?
2. Are the charts self explanatory to any extent? What is good? What is bad? What could be improved and something you would like to see? Would you have preffered any other kinds of data visualizations?
3. How is the flow coming up? What stands out to you from the entire story?
4. Do you have any questions about the site? Is anything which I should include or highlight? 

## Interviews:

Here is the summary of interviews and in class peer assessment:

### Interview 1:

(Female, Consultant, 26 years old)

According to the project flow I have developed, I would first ask them broad questions on their view on the flow and structure. and then would narrow down my questions specific to slides:

1. What do you think this story is for? What points do you think I am trying to convey here?

Answer: Trying to build a story around how can an individual utilize solar energy, and motivate them to switch to renewable energy. How and why one can shift to renewable energy, after summarizing fundamentals of renewable energy.

2. Who do you think is the intended audience for this story? Why is that and how is the story relevant to them?

Answer: Residential customers are potential customers of this student in her view. Because the solutions mentioned in the story revolve around residential customers.

After that, I would briefly explain the story to them and then ask the following questions:

1. How do you think are the charts coming up to highlight the crux of every section?

Answer: RE overview section: life cycle emissions chart clearly shows that conventional energy resources are bad, but yellow color for showing emissions associated with solar energy was not clear enough to highlight the comparison. 

India's Solar Power Installed Capacity, India's solar energy progress in last decade, and Renewable energy targets by 2030 charts are clear enough to highlight relevant data and trends.


2. Are the charts self explanatory to any extent? What is good? What is bad? What could be improved and something you would like to see? Would you have preffered any other kinds of data visualizations?


Answer: 

1st chart: Yellow color in bar chart is not going well. It would be better if solar energy data label was there to clearly see that emissions related to solar energy is where the focus should be. Heading of the chart around the narrative of the story, something like “Solar energy’s life cycle emissions comparison to conventional energy sources”.
2nd chart: For ease of understanding, it would be better to remain consistent with colors for all charts. Preferably use the same colors as from the first chart of solar energy bar into the map.
3rd chart: Two different scales in Y-axis increase eye travel and efforts for the reader. Data labels in the yearly installed capacity timeseries (line on the graph) will make it easier to read. Yellow color is a little too bright? The reader got confused between which series to follow and focus upon while trying to understand the graph.
4th chart: Flow till residential solar energy system block should be highlighted. Less professional as compared to other graphics.


3. How is the flow coming up? What stands out to you from the entire story?

Answer: Overall, the flow makes sense as the story is narrowed down to a specific call to action. The thing that stood out was the link between nationwide targets and progress, and how can an individual contribute in this story. It is important to make people aware and motivated for such actions, which this story covers well.

However, without narrating the story beforehand, one could assume that the flow would be meant for any categories of consumers, such as industrial, commercial or residential.

4. Do you have any questions about the site? Is anything which I should include or highlight?

Answer: No questions.

Couple of broad suggestions: 1) Maintaining color consistency throughout the flow
2) It would make more meaningful for readers if the story is concluding with potential monetary benefits and environmental impacts by the actions taken by an individual.



### Interview 2:

According to the project flow I have developed, I would first ask them broad questions on their view on the flow and structure. and then would narrow down my questions specific to slides:

1. What do you think this story is for? What points do you think I am trying to convey here?

Answer: The story seems to be about solar energy progress in India. Flow is nicely summarized. India has progressed a lot in last decade. Specifically, some states have performed better than others. Outlined what kinds of systems are available and can be developed. India also has a goal for 2030, and that there are different sectors applicable.


2. Who do you think is the intended audience for this story? Why is that and how is the story relevant to them?

Answer: General public. Because the language is easy to understand, and not very technical. As a citizen, she would like to know how India’s is doing in solar energy transition, what is government doing to achieve their decarbonization goals and what kind of steps are being taken to achieve those goals.


After that, I would briefly explain the story to them and then ask the following questions:

1. How do you think are the charts coming up to highlight the crux of every section?

Answer: 1st chart, 2nd and 4th chart justify the points the author is trying to convey. 3rd chart is not that self explanatory, and the presenter might have to explain the chart to convey all the data points included.

2. Are the charts self explanatory to any extent? What is good? What is bad? What could be improved and something you would like to see? Would you have preffered any other kinds of data visualizations?

Answer: Overall, the charts are visually self explanatory, they are colored well and makes it easier to understand for readers. 3rd chart conveys a lot of information, one of the graphs could be used as both of them make the same point.

3. How is the flow coming up? What stands out to you from the entire story?

Answer: Flow is okay. The reader could not figure out what message is being conveyed in “What can YOU do?” section. Is it a positive or negative call to action? 


4. Do you have any questions about the site? Is there anything which I should include or highlight? 

Answer: Few more graphs in those section would make more sense. Some of residential solar energy stats, or cases would give reader a point to relate with. Even some statistics from different sectors like industrial, agricultural and commercial sectors would provide more reliability to the story. Those charts would have given a clearer picture of the entire narrative of the story.





### Interview 3:

According to the project flow I have developed, I would first ask them broad questions on their view on the flow and structure. and then would narrow down my questions specific to slides:

1. What do you think this story is for? What points do you think I am trying to convey here?

Answer: The story addresses how important solar energy could be in India’s renewable energy transition, what steps government of India has taken so far and how are they important to meet climate goals by 2030. 

Points conveyed: Why is important for India to move towards renewable energy sources, especially solar energy. Also, how has India progressed in solar installed capacity, and what further steps should be taken.


2. Who do you think is the intended audience for this story? Why is that and how is the story relevant to them?

Answer: General public who want to know India’s solar energy progress. Also the story could be relevant to project developers. General public: to make people aware about India’s solar energy progress at a glance.
Project developers: It will give them ideas what regions to target for their further business development. Government support for project developers could give them resources to grow their project further. 



After that, I would briefly explain the story to them and then ask the following questions:

1. How do you think are the charts coming up to highlight the crux of every section?

Answer: 

1st section: Yes. 
2nd chart: Yes.
3rd chart: Yes. 
4th chart: It is not clear that the chart should focus on residential category of solar energy systems, it just provides a hierarchy of India’s renewable energy targets.
Charts should have been added for the final section.

2. Are the charts self explanatory to any extent? What is good? What is bad? What could be improved and something you would like to see? Would you have preffered any other kinds of data visualizations?

Answer:

1st and 2nd charts convey the data effectively to the reader. Colors and highlighted section here are outlined perfectly. In the Indian map chart though, outer boundary of the map would make the chart clearer in the white background.

3rd chart: Somehow, he thought that the yellow timeseries is reflecting data from the Y-axis on right side, and blue line chart on the left axis. Data point for 2022 - present seems to be lower than the previous year, when that is not the case. 2021-22 shows installed capacity for the entire year, while the latest data point is only for the first five months (april to august).

4th chart: The reader could follow the flow of the chart till rooftop solar box, as they have numbers written within the boxes, but further the message fades away. Colors could be used to highlight the flow which should be highlighted within the chart. Potentially a pie chart could be created to show chunks of solar energy and breakdown of its category downstream.

3. How is the flow coming up? What stands out to you from the entire story?

Answer: A smoother shift would make the story easier to understand when transitioningfrom larger picture to individual level narrative. 

What stands out is people would know that carbon emissions should be lowered down, but India’s emphasis on solar energy is huge. Also, impact from individuals to contribute to such a larger picture is conveyed well.


4. Do you have any questions about the site? Is anything which I should include or highlight? 
Answer: No questions. No comments.


### In class discussion:


Team members liked the flow, but they felt the story was incomplete as the final section of the story did not have any visualizations. Further, in the 450 GW graph of India’s renewable energy targets, they suggested me to focus more on residential customers more as the story is supposed to revolve around them. A suggestion for that graphic was that scrolling animation in shorthand would be useful to make that graph.

Further, conflicting views were discussed about how to align text and graphics on the screen, being consistent with keeping text and graphics on the same side of the screen, or switch their columns left and right.
