# Part 2: Final Project

## Shorthand flow:

I have started building my final project on shorthand. The screenshots below gives a broad structure of my shorthand story. For now, I intend to keep flow of the story in the following manner:

1. Title Slide: Solar Energy progress in India
2. Background slide: What is renewable energy? How is it better than conventional energy?
3. India's Progress and targets: How much progress has India made to meet their targets by 2030?
4. Type of solar energy systems: Out of total target of 450 GW, how much from that is allocated for solar? How much for solar rooftop sites?
5. What can you as an individual do?
6. Government subsidies and schemes to motivate residential customers
7. References


Description in each sections will provide detailed context about rationale of the story, and infographics should attract readers to increase their engagement.

## User research and interview questionnaire:

According the project flow I have developed, I would first ask them broad questions on their view on the flow and structure. and then would narrow down my questions specific to slides:

1. What do you think this story is for? What points do you think I am trying to convey here?
2. Who do you think is the intended audience for this story? Why is that and how is the story relevant to them?

After that, I would briefly explain the story to them and then ask the following questions:

1. How do you think are the charts coming up to highlight the crux of every section?
2. Are the charts self explanatory to any extent? What is good? What is bad? What could be improved and something you would like to see? Would you have preffered any other kinds of data visualizations?
3. How is the flow coming up? What stands out to you from the entire story?
4. Do you have any questions about the site? Is anything which I should include or highlight?
