## Part 1: Finding a visualization

I wanted to find the recent visualization, which can be relateable to most of the class. That is why I found this article on NBC news:

Source: NBCUniversal News Group. (2022, September 13). Inflation tracker: How much are prices rising for U.S. consumers? NBCNews.com. Retrieved September 20, 2022, from https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/inflation-tracker-how-much-prices-rising-us-consumers-n1296378  


In my view, the graphic.is trying to convey a lot of information. There are 8 categories of monthly data, and different colors are allocated for the entire range of values. The graphic wants to convey year on year percentage change of inflation in all the categories. At the first look, I found the graphic very interesting as it was made in an unusual way. The scale at the top of graphic and colored blocks to represent every data point seemed appealing from aesthetics point of view, but they failed to give me any detailed insights from the data. I could only get a high level idea of the year on year percentage change for that category looking at the scale legend mentioned above the graphic..

## Part 2: Critique the data visualization

To critique this visualization, Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile method was used. Here is my critique:

What I liked about this graphic is that there is no overlapping of different categories unlike line chart. All categories of inflation has their data is depicted separately. I also liked use of colors, and feel that there is no redundancy in using colors. I also liked the interactiveness of the graphic, as it shows the exact percentage when we hover over those rectangles. With regard to Stephen Few’s critique method, I liked the usefulness, completeness and aesthetics of the graphic as it provides useful inflation information for all citizens that covers major categories used by consumers. 

What I did not like about the graphic was its inability to convey and compare information it intends to convey effectively. It is difficult to figure out the exact year-on-year percentage price change for various categories of goods and services without hovering the mouse over that specific category and time period. Also there are no clear distinction of how the colors are allocated to data range. The scale given is vague, and does not provide any intuitive information about how it is divided into percentages. For instance, all the data inflation points more than 15% year-on-year changes are allocated with the same shade of color. Therefore, price change in cars in September 2021 (15%) and gas in May 2022 (52.8%) are highlighted with the same color. However, reader would not realize that until they hover over both the rectangles in graphic, which seems misleading to me. Therefore, I have given poor ranks to graphic’s perceptibility, intuitiveness and truthfulness measures. Also, it takes a lot of hand and eye movement to clearly understand and compare the information of graphic, since there are a lot of data points and exact data is accessible only when readers hover over rectangles. Much efforts would distract and demotivate readers to learn more about data. Therefore, I have given 4 points in engagement category.

In summary, I would rank the visualization by Few's categories: 

### Informative:

• Usefulness: 9
• Completeness: 10
• Perceptibility: 3
• Truthfulness: 2
• Intuitivenes: 4

### Emotive:

• Aesthetics: 7
• Engagement: 4
