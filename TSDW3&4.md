# Assignment 3&4

## Part 1: Finding a visualization

I wanted to find the recent visualization, which can be relateable to most of the class. That is why I found this article on NBC news:

Source: NBCUniversal News Group. (2022, September 13). Inflation tracker: How much are prices rising for U.S. consumers? NBCNews.com. Retrieved September 20, 2022, from https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/inflation-tracker-how-much-prices-rising-us-consumers-n1296378  


In my view, the graphic.is trying to convey a lot of information. There are 8 categories of monthly data, and different colors are allocated for the entire range of values. The graphic wants to convey year on year percentage change of inflation in all the categories. At the first look, I found the graphic very interesting as it was made in an unusual way. The scale at the top of graphic and colored blocks to represent every data point seemed appealing from aesthetics point of view, but they failed to give me any detailed insights from the data. I could only get a high level idea of the year on year percentage change for that category looking at the scale legend mentioned above the graphic..

## Part 2: Critique the data visualization

To critique this visualization, Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile method was used. Here is my critique:

What I liked about this graphic is that there is no overlapping of different categories unlike line chart. All categories of inflation has their data is depicted separately. I also liked use of colors, and feel that there is no redundancy in using colors. I also liked the interactiveness of the graphic, as it shows the exact percentage when we hover over those rectangles. With regard to Stephen Few’s critique method, I liked the usefulness, completeness and aesthetics of the graphic as it provides useful inflation information for all citizens that covers major categories used by consumers. 

What I did not like about the graphic was its inability to convey and compare information it intends to convey effectively. It is difficult to figure out the exact year-on-year percentage price change for various categories of goods and services without hovering the mouse over that specific category and time period. Also there are no clear distinction of how the colors are allocated to data range. The scale given is vague, and does not provide any intuitive information about how it is divided into percentages. For instance, all the data inflation points more than 15% year-on-year changes are allocated with the same shade of color. Therefore, price change in cars in September 2021 (15%) and gas in May 2022 (52.8%) are highlighted with the same color. However, reader would not realize that until they hover over both the rectangles in graphic, which seems misleading to me. Therefore, I have given poor ranks to graphic’s perceptibility, intuitiveness and truthfulness measures. Also, it takes a lot of hand and eye movement to clearly understand and compare the information of graphic, since there are a lot of data points and exact data is accessible only when readers hover over rectangles. Much efforts would distract and demotivate readers to learn more about data. Therefore, I have given 4 points in engagement category.

In summary, I would rank the visualization by Few's categories: 

### Informative:

• Usefulness: 9
• Completeness: 10
• Perceptibility: 3
• Truthfulness: 2
• Intuitivenes: 4

### Emotive:

• Aesthetics: 7
• Engagement: 4

## Part 3: Sketch out a solution

![IMG_20220919_171307__01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113068886/191329011-3f993cb9-4933-4445-8c34-2d81ea079af4.jpg)

With this sketch, I wanted to make the clear scale to label data points by which comparing the data points in the same categories and with other categories could get easier. Therefore, I created a line chart to make it simpler to comprehend  for its intended audience, that in my opinion are retail consumers. I further expanded the scale to the highest data point (around 60%) available in the dataset to clearly divide the scale linearly. I also reduced the number of different shades of color without marking by graying out all the subcategories of googs and highlighted overall inflation, as too many colors are only making the graphic a little complicated to read.

## Part4: Test a solution

After creating a sketch, I interviewed two of my friends to get their feedback on the sketch. Below are summaries of those interviews: 

### Interview 1 (Student, 23 years)
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
This graph is showing year on year change in inflation rates for many categories. Overall inflation and all the subcategories of inflation is considered in this graphic.
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The graph shows how some categories influence overall inflation, while impact of other categories are not that prevalent. Also, overall inflation in this category is weighted average of all the other categories.
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
In the first look, year over year was not clear in the scale. It looked like lines are giving us a linear story that tells you month over month trend, instead of year over year price change from the same month in last year.  Also, airfare is included in every other category was a little surprising. All other categories are necessities, but not the airfare.
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Looking and understanding the graph, retail consumers and average income households could be intended audience for the graphic, as fluctuations in prices would affect their expenditure decisions accordingly.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
There are some categories that they think are not seasonal, such as cars, meat and eggs, and housing. Therefore, some categories might be more relevant than others when the graphic intends to convey any specific information. Otherwise, it is fine to keep all the categories.

### Interview 2 (Consultant, 26 years):
 
- Describe a chart in a couple of sentences
Year on year change in inflation for multiple categories, and trying to highlight overall inflation for the months of september 2021 to August 2022. 
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Airfare and gas has shown significant fluctuations over the year.
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Confusing when the title says year over year and axis is showing months, it looks like monntly data is comparing values with previous months. It is because of line graph, which kind of connects the data points that are showing price changes from the same month of previous year.
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Anyone who is trying to study inflation. Retail consumers
- Is there anything you would change or do differently? 
The graphic is okay for overall study of inflation. But, it does not tell any other information about any particular trends or results. 
For the original chart, the scale could be divided further into categories for the higher values to comprehend it better.
- Is there anything you like or dislike about the chart vs the original one?
The original one is good to just get the trend in some categories, such as gas or airfare but is indeed misleading by coloring 15% change and 50% change in same shades. 
 
Post interview comparison:
After both interviews, I showed both interviewees the original chart as well to give them context and clear comparison. After looking at both graphics, they gave similar comments about the scale of the original chart. Initially, they liked the aesthetics of the original chart, but when I asked them to hover over rectangles and to figure out the issues, they came up with all similar insights that I found. They did not like how the scale of percentage change was described in the original chart, and they also failed to get the idea of data points just looking at the chart with colors. 
Additional comment after comparing both charts were that the title in my sketch was unclear and confusing. It did not provide required overview or motive to look at the visual. 

## Part 5: Redesigning 

Here is my final redesigning after considering feedbacks from interviewees:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11228376"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

While translating my sketch to Flourish, I considered all the points from my sketch. The major change was to make such a title that would give readers a clear idea of significance of the line chart. Also, since data in the original visualization was taken from multiple data sources, I manually created a table in Microsoft Excel of all data points in the original visualization. After iporting that datasheet to Flourish, I created a line chart with appropriate title and labels. Further, I grayed out lines of all subcategories, and kept overall inflation in red color. I did that keeping in mind intended audience of the chart to be retail consumers, who would be okay with studying a high level trend of those subcategories without going into too much detail. Therefore, those categories would work as a supporting data of major goods and services, and overview inflation would give a overall bird eye view.

## Part 6: Discussion with peers

Another round of peer assessment was in class, where we in a group of three gave feedbacks to each other's graphics. After my explanation, both of them were okay with my chart and approach and gave positive feedback. There was only one comment which I found to be quite useful, is that line of 'overall inflation' could be highlighted in red instead of blue, as inflation is not a positive measure to read for retail consumers. Consumers would not want the commodity orices to go up. Therefore, I changed it to red color and published it again. Here is my final visualization:

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11228376"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
